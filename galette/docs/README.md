Galette API documentation can be generated using apigen (http://www.apigen.org/).

A file named apigen.neaon is provided in the sources to automate the process.
To generate the documentation, just run from galette main directory:

$ apigen generate

HTML files will be generated into 'apidocs' directory.

API documentation is generated every night along with the nighlty archive;
you can see it at:
